# Sorter-Typescript.
- a simple typescript sorting application     that sorts through multiple data types


 # Data Types
    1. Character collections ( a string of characters that will be sorted through alphabetically)
    2. Number collections (an array of values in any order that will be sorted through least to greatest)
    3.Linked List (is a linear collection of values that is sorted by the next value it points to not the place in memory or the numerical value).
# Sorter
- first we create a sortable interface which requires two functions to be completed for a collection to be sorted through. 

- Second sorter class that takes the sortable interface defined on line two (Sorter.ts). We then start the sorting function where we interate through a specific collection that will reference the sortable interface which contains our two key functions. compare and swap.
